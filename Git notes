The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and itâ€™s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:

$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

Checking Your Settings
If you want to check your configuration settings, you can use the git config --list command to list all the settings Git can find at that point:

$git config --list 
$git config --list --show-origin
