The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:
Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use

$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

Checking Your Settings
If you want to check your configuration settings, you can use the git config --list command to list all the settings Git can find at that point:

$git config --list 
$git config --list --show-origin


$ git add -h
usage: git add [<options>] [--] <pathspec>...

    -n, --dry-run               dry run
    -v, --verbose               be verbose

    -i, --interactive           interactive picking
    -p, --patch                 select hunks interactively
    -e, --edit                  edit current diff and apply
    -f, --force                 allow adding otherwise ignored files
    -u, --update                update tracked files
    --renormalize               renormalize EOL of tracked files (implies -u)
    -N, --intent-to-add         record only the fact that the path will be added later
    -A, --all                   add changes from all tracked and untracked files
    --ignore-removal            ignore paths removed in the working tree (same as --no-all)
    --refresh                   don't add, only refresh the index
    --ignore-errors             just skip files which cannot be added because of errors
    --ignore-missing            check if - even missing - files are ignored in dry run
    --chmod (+|-)x              override the executable bit of the listed files
    --pathspec-from-file <file> read pathspec from file
    --pathspec-file-nul         with --pathspec-from-file, pathspec elements are separated with NUL character

    This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet. See Git Internals for more information about exactly what files are contained in the .git directory you just created.

    $git init

    this is all imprtant command
